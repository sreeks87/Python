# Time Complexity
# Since all the nodes and vertices are visited, the average time complexity for DFS on a graph is O(V + E)O(V+E), where VV is the number of vertices and EE is the number of edges. In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is O(V)O(V), where VV is the number of nodes.

# Note: We say average time complexity because a setâ€™s in operation has an average time complexity of O(1)O(1). If we used a list, the complexity would be higher.
